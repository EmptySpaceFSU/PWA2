        eLEAF was originally started by three young collegiate boys. They were hard working,
        and believed that you only got out of something what you put into it. They joined
        together and started a landscaping business, and over the next decade refined their
        system to keep track of all their jobs. That was 75 years ago, and the ideals havenâ€™t
        changed a bit. We believe in making the world a better place, one lawn at a time. We
        do it, by offering the project management system that has helped keep the company
        number one for almost a century.

                    In a world with so much chaos, we believe in revolutionizing clarity. We also
                    happen to make Project Management Software.
